## Snowman's hat

Now let's add a hat to the snowman. The hat will be made from a cylinder.

+ Add a **Cylinder** from the Toolbox's **Create** tab.

The cylinder might be added inside the UV sphere, so once again use the blue handle to move it upwards.

+ Move the cylinder on top of the snowman's head using the blue, green, and red move handles.

+ Render to see what the snowman looks like. For example:
